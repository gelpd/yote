Organize and write machine learning logs and metrics *easily*

### Introduction
Solutions for organizing and storing metrics for machine learning experiments is a pain.
Existing solutions involve annoying setup instructions, dependence on infrastructural components,
and might be dependent on a machine learning framework choices.

Yote is built to integrate seamlessly with any code you write in python. It operates
locally by default, but gives you the flexibility to emit metrics to services like Prometheus. 

### Usage
To use yote in your machine learning code, see the following example:

```
from yote import Experiment
experiment = Experiment()

while training:
    # doing work...
    experiment.emit({"loss": 0.3, "mse": 21}, stage="train")

```
TODO: To read metrics and logs from your machine learning experiment, see the following example:
