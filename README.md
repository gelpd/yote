### Introduction
Solutions for organizing and storing metrics for machine learning experiments is a pain.
Existing solutions involve annoying setup instructions, dependence on infrastructural components,

Yote is built to integrate seamlessly with any code you write in python. It uses sql-lite to organize metrics
locally by default, but gives you the flexibility to emit metrics to services like Prometheus.
